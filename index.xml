      <description>This post is a work in progress. I will try and register here tweaks I&amp;rsquo;ve used in order to solve glitches after a fresh Arch Linux install with the xfce desktop environment. Things are written in a Q&amp;amp;A fashion in no particular order (that is, in random order :)).
xfce takes forever to start. clear the cache with rm -rf .config/ .cache/ .gnome*
there is no internet. wpa_supplicant is missing.</description>
