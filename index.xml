      <title>Running Windows games on Linux with Steam Play</title>

      <description>There are tons of tutorials going over how to try and run Windows games directly from Linux using Steam. After following a mix of advices from various places, I still could not run any Windows games. They would crash shortly after a &amp;ldquo;Preparing to launch&amp;rdquo; popup appeared.
In many cases, crashes are caused by stuff that has nothing to do with the games themselves. To figure out what is going on, it&amp;rsquo;s a great idea to enable detailed logging.</description>

      <description>I have registered here some tweaks to solve glitches after a fresh Arch Linux install with the xfce desktop environment. Things are written in a Q&amp;amp;A fashion in no particular order (that is, in random order :)).
xfce takes forever to start. clear the cache with rm -rf .config/ .cache/ .gnome*
there is no internet. wpa_supplicant is missing. start a live Arch Linux environment (from a USB drive or CD), chroot to your system, and then install the packages required to connect to the internet.</description>
