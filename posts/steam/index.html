				<p>There are <a href="https://itsfoss.com/steam-play">tons</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-play-windows-games-in-linux">of</a> <a href="https://segmentnext.com/2018/12/06/steam-proton-guide">tutorials</a> going over how to try and run Windows games directly from Linux using Steam. After following a mix of advices from various places, I still could not run any Windows games. They would crash shortly after a &ldquo;Preparing to launch&rdquo; popup appeared.</p>
<p>In many cases, crashes are caused by stuff that has nothing to do with the games themselves. To figure out what is going on, it&rsquo;s a great idea to enable detailed logging. To do that, find the <code>user_settings.sample.py</code> file under the Proton folder. Mine was located at <code>$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/Proton 5.0</code>. Open it, set <code>&quot;DXVK_LOG_LEVEL&quot;</code> to <code>&quot;debug&quot;</code> and then rename the file to <code>user_settings.py</code>. After making these changes and restarting Steam, when you try to launch a game, a log named <code>steam-GAMEID.log</code> will be saved to your <code>$HOME</code> folder.</p>
<p>In my case, the log files said that Steam had no permission to access game files. My laptop has a tiny SDD wherein only the OS and some essential libs are installed, and a large HDD in which heavy files, such as games, are stored. It turns out that this HDD was mounted to a point owned by <code>root</code>. Using <code>chown</code> to change ownership does not work in this case, since the HDD is formatted in NTFS, and NTFS does not allow fine-grained (folder or file) ownership assignment. Running games directly from the command line via <code>sudo steam steam://rungameid/{MY_GAME_ID}</code> does not work either, because Steam will not run anything under <code>sudo</code> (it is a terrible idea anyway :)).</p>
<p>It is possible, however, to change the ownership of the entire mounting point. This should be ok if the HDD is not accessed by multiple users, and can be done by changing the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file. Find the line referring to the HDD mount and add user/group info. It should look something like this</p>
<pre><code>UUID={MY_PARTITION_ID} /hdd ntfs defaults,uid={MY_OWNER_USER},gid={MY_OWNER_GROUP} 0 0
</code></pre><p>A list of all partitions and their UUIDs can be retrieved via <code>sudo blkid</code>.</p>
<p>After updating fstab, reboot. Check that HDD ownership was updated and get ready to play.</p>
